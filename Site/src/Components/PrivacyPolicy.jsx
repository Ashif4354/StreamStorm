          <h2>1. No Personal Data Collection</h2>
          <p>

          <h2>2. Anonymous Analytics</h2>
          <p>
            We use analytics to understand how users interact with the app. This includes page visits (like this privacy policy) and actions such as downloading the application or viewing the GitHub repository.
            However, this data is completely anonymous. We do not know who you are and cannot identify you in any way. The information we collect is general and helps us improve the application experience.

        <section>
          <h2>3. Internet Usage</h2>
          <p>
            The app uses the internet only for:
            <ul>
              <li>Checking for software updates</li>
              <li>Downloading required browser webdrivers</li>
              <li>Sending analytics data</li>
            </ul>
            These operations are technical and do not involve any personal data.

          <h2>5. Offline-Friendly</h2>

          <h2>6. Third-Party Services</h2>
          <p>
